# enroll_users.py
#
# Description:
# This script enrolls two specified users into all Canvas courses for a given term
# with the "TA" (Teacher Assistant) role.
#
# It's designed to be run in a server environment where configuration is provided
# via environment variables for security.
#
# Required Python packages:
# requests
#
# To install dependencies:
# pip install requests
#
# Environment Variables to set before running:
# 1. CANVAS_API_URL: Your institution's Canvas URL (e.g., "https://triviumcharter.instructure.com")
# 2. CANVAS_API_KEY: Your Canvas API access token.
# 3. CANVAS_TERM_ID: The ID of the term you want to process courses from.
# 4. CANVAS_SUBACCOUNT_ID: The account ID to search for users within.
# 5. SEARCH_ROOT_ACCOUNT (optional): Set to "true" to search for courses across the entire institution.
